    <p>
        Candlelight bounces off an empty broken bronze mug as titan stares into it. This mug had been through so much, it was Titans favorite, and it broke when he was kicked out of his mountain home so many years ago. That was so long ago now, since the time when he was "the Ghost of Blackpowder mine". He thought of Broderon, back then. He remembered Ansel and Reymond, two random mercenaries that Broderon punked into being good guys, later helping them defend Dawnbell. He missed Broderon, Elondir too. Titan sat there, quiet, across from Nox and Kade pacing back and forth arguing on what to do next.
        <br><br>
        "We need to plan to hold out here. Theres no reason we need to go outside, its raining acid and more of those striders are lurking. its too dangerous.." Nox commanded the group, after all it was his orphanage.
        <br><br>
        "Yes I agree but others are still out there, even if we can save a few..." Kade returned before being interrupted.
        <br><br>
        "Broderon is gone." Titan interjects solemnly.
        <br><br>
        Nox takes a seat across from titan. "Look I uh, we all know, but we."
        <br><br>
        "You don't know. I was there, when the Ebon chalice came riding into the market town. They rounded us up, we were all to die. But HE stood against them. I was there when he leaped from the bottom of a frozen lake. I was there when HE CHARMED A F*CKING DRAGON. Yeah this tooth! Abraxas! He tried to eat us, tried to put us all. To sleep. And BRODERON said nope. Im just gonna charm a f*cking dragon." Titan rambles loudly yelling into the air waiving his dragon tooth dagger. 
        <br><br>
        "Put the dagger down, there's children," Nox says moving his hand slowly to his own dagger.
        <br><br>
        Kade could cut the tension with a knife, but he was too slow.
        "Boys, calm down, all this fighting is making me bloodthirsty. Broderon will be missed, but he is ALSO responsible for bringing ME back to life. So I owe him something, I just wish I knew why he brought me back." Morgan interjects. 
        <br><br>
        Vondal snorts, passed out completely drunk, in a chair. Trying to erase any memory of that, strider that caused him so much fear.
        <br><br>
        Morgan is right. The zealot steps in.
        <br><br>
        "Broderon indeed is part of some divine plan. I have seen it too. On that day Titan, in the market square, you became part of it, and you Nox, when and your friends were captured by the Ebon Chalice, it is HIS sister you encountered there no? Even the devil himself, slain by Broderon. We are all witness to his power, and yet here we all are without him, what would he have us do?"
        <br><br>
        Vondal snorts again, still snoring while sleeping drunk, but he mutters something this time. Sounds like goblin.
        <br><br>
        "Goblin?" Titan says before tearing up, still thinking of Broderon. 
        <br><br>
        Kade thinks of Brak, that damned goblin he killed. But then immediately his mind goes to Lilith. Whats happening with the others? Whats going on at the capital? Will they ever see them again?
